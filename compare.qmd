# Introduction to irrigation energy

There may be two sources of water:

1.  surface

2.  ground

Ground water will have a 'head' associated with the depth of the well. Both will have 'head' associated with the pump pressure. Â 

The main components defining the irrigation energy use are:

1.  The pump pressure and, if ground water, the well depth

2.  The energy source for the pumping/moving of water (diesel, electricity, solar, etc.)

3.  The amount of irrigation water applied

# Scenario

-   A flood irrigated field

-   Diesel powered pump

-   150 foot well

-   25 PSI pump

-   \$1 energy unit (to make back-calculating the amount of fuel easy)

-   Alfalfa

-   1 acre

-   64 ac-in applied per acre

    ```{r}
    well_depth_ft <- 150
    pump_press_psi <- 25
    water_applied_in_ac <- 64
    ```

# FTM equations

The total head is expressed as the sum of the head from the pump pressure and the pumping depth (Latex sucks in this environment):

head \[m\] = pumping pressure \[m\] + well depth \[m\]

To calculate the head we therefore just need to do some unit conversions.

```{r}
pump_press_m <- pump_press_psi * mhead_per_psi
well_depth_m <- well_depth_ft * m_per_ft

head_m <- pump_press_m + well_depth_m
print(round(head_m, 0))
```

The general equation is then:

energy \[MJ\] = c_units \* water applied \[mm\] \* hectares applied to \[ha\] \* head \[m\] / efficiencies

It is confusing how it is not on a per acre basis. In FTM eqns they multiply by the area of the field, then divide by it, so it just cancels out.

Constants provided by FTM (no citations):

```{r}
# constants, no idea of units
c_units <- 0.0979 #I think this is essentially the gravity constant, 9.8 kg-m/s2

e_pump <- 0.75
e_irr <- 1
e_gear <- 0.95
e_power <- 1


```

Change water applied in-ac to mm-ha

```{r}
water_applied_mm_ha <- water_applied_in_ac * mm_per_in * ha_per_ac

(num1 <- c_units * head_m * water_applied_mm_ha)
(den1 <- e_pump * e_irr * e_gear * e_power)

ftm_mj_per_ha <- num1/den1 #--is this per hectare???

#--change to btu per ac, as that is what FTM reports
#--are the units per ha?
ftm_btu_per_ac <- ftm_mj_per_ha * btu_per_mj * ha_per_ac
#--or per acre already? Since we assumed 1 acre? Is the water applied actually in-ac/ac?
ftm_btu_per_ac2 <- ftm_mj_per_ha * btu_per_mj

prettyNum(ftm_btu_per_ac2, big.mark = ",", scientific = F)
```

The Field Calculator gives 5,436,395 BTU/acre. So you shouldn't do the conversion, the value is on a per acre basis already.
